The first week of class has gone by fast. As much as I miss having my phone or laptop out during class, I think I’ll be able to learn a lot from this course.

What did you do this past week?
	This past week we reviewed some syntax and architecture as applied in python. This includes what types of values are returned and what kind of values should be on the left side or right side of an equation. We also began project 1 and went over the syllabus for this short summer session.
	
What's in your way?
Currently, I think the instructions are very lacking. I was stuck on a bug using Sphere that always returned compilation error or runtime error and yet my code worked with the test cases fed into it. I thought something was wrong with how I set up my SphereCollatz.py file because I wasnt getting “wrong answer”. I was getting errors. Eventually I figured out that runtime error could also be caused by some input cases which don’t conform to the ones used in the test cases. This caused lots of headache when the solution was actually very simple. I never thought I would be so happy in my life to see “Time limit exceeded” after I fixed that bug and got Sphere to finally work.

What will you do next week?
	Next week we will begin project 2. We will talk about pair programming and probably start understanding factorials, variables, caches, copies, and reductions in python.
