What did you do this past week?
This past week, we learned more about lists, tuples, classes, functions, lazy and eager generators, iterables, iterators, unpacking, positional declaring, name declaring, and other syntax rules. We also gained more practice writing Classes and generators from scratch, which will undoubtedly be very useful for the first exam tomorrow.
What's in your way?
General lacking motivation is in my way. With such a fast paced course, it is sometimes difficult to stay motivated enough to complete all the work as well as study, especially over the summer break. I’m looking forward to group work, though. I think that being able to work side by side along with my peers, especially on a website project of our own choosing, will be way more fun than stumbling through a project assignment at home alone.
What will you do next week?
Tomorrow, we have the first exam of class. I’ve been studying all day today and some yesterday as well. I assume we’ll also find out who is in our project groups and will be assigned project 3. Hopefully, we will have time in class to meet with our team members and discuss what kind of website we want to build.
Tip of the week:
Ask questions on Canvas Discussions or Piazza! Other students are very helpful and finding out information by asking questions can sometimes be a lot faster and less stressful than spending hours trying to figure it out alone. If you are in a hurry, head to the computer lab in GDC. There are usually fellow students in there too.
