What did you do this past week?
This past week we turned our static website into a dynamic website. This meant we had to scrape Spotifyâ€™s web API to populate our database. We also had to scrape data from Last.fm API to get data on various genres. We also started on the final portion of our group project. We created a bubbly visualization for Writers Block. This visualization contains various sized bubbles that represent the number of books with a certain range of page numbers. We also started implementing a search function in our website, sweetify.me.
What's in your way?
Nothing is in my way! I am an unstoppable force of nature! But other than that, I guess scheduling conflicts has been somewhat of an issue this weekend, as I had mandatory appointments from 2 to 5 both saturday and sunday. My group members typically met at 2-5 saturday and sunday, so this was a slight issue. However, I worked on the presentation from home after I finished with my appointments, so I could still contribute. And Monday and Tuesday, I have no other commitments so I can devote myself to the group project.
What will you do next week?
Finish up the final project and start studying for the final exam!

Tip of the week:
Walk through the turtle pond and then take the stairs down through welch to get to the CS building. This maximizes the pokemon go encounters you will have when you go meet your team.
